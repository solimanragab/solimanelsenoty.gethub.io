                    How Smart Are Tigers?
                    Besides great stories about their body size and strength, tigers have a great combination of intelligence and fighting skills. They are considered to be the most villainous, rough, calculating, and strategically intelligent predators
                    The evidence can be found in their habitat adaptation and hunting styles. Unlike other big cats, the tigers’ diet includes a combination of land-based animals like buffalos, deer, and chitals and aquatic life, including crocodiles and fish.
                    
                    For instance, when hunting buffalos, tigers don’t run and attack aimlessly because a group of large animals can quickly overrun them if they launch a counteroffensive.
                    Instead of a haphazard attack, tigers identify a target and launch a fake attack to separate their prey from the crowd, then attack targeting the neck.
                    
                    For aquatic life-like crocodiles, which are also fierce creatures, tigers get extra strategic. They aim at the soft underbelly of the crocodile instead of the hard body scales of the crocodile in the neck.</p>
